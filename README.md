# Projects
The repository contains the blog posts for my major open-source project contributions.
The projects are built under the supervision of mentors and are systematically designed and implemented.

## List of projects:
- [Learner Diagnostic Test](https://github.com/Nik-09/major-projects/blob/main/LearnerDiagnosticTest.md)
- [Schema Validation Project](https://github.com/Nik-09/major-projects/blob/main/SchemaValidationSystem.md)
