## Schema Validation System

**Introduction:**
Built a validation system for validating handler arguments against their schema.
The schema validation system, robustly validates the arguments coming to the backend and raises errors (if any) even before the arguments reach the backend code.
The schema validation system normalizes the arguments into the expected data type. The schema validation system also supports eventual migration from the old codebase structure _(which does not support schema validation of arguments)_ to the new structure _(which will be supported by schema validation)_.
The correctness of the schema validation system is checked by the suite of unit tests.

**Tech stack**:
Python, Typescript, Unit tests, Pylint.

**Duration:**
3 months.
